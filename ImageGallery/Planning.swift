 Planning ImageGallery:
 
 Cassini Splitview with URL fetch and multithreading left off minute 24 of lecture 10
 
 EmojiArt app demo starts like 10 mins in to Lecture 11
 
 Table view demo starts 15 mins from the end of Lecture 11
 
 Collection view demo is in lecture 12
 
 Persistence
 
 Starts at lecture 13 at 15 mins in - UIDocument slides start 54 mins in
 
 Good overview of the whole process to implement UIDocument at beginning of lecture 14
 
 UIDocument demo begins ~12 mins in to lecture 14
 
 Plan for beginning of Project 6:
 
 1) Need to create model
    - Can delete all of TableView controller (but not immediately)
    - Table view controller only sends us the selectedArtist and the selectedArtist's URLs
    - Think we can make a new model file with just those two things
        - I think we grab the UIImage and aspect ratios later (once we know the URLs)
    - Need to figure out a way to set a selectedArtist and their URLs
        - Maybe it's just a temporary function that populates our model with those
        - Until we get the UIDocument view working
